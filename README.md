## A BACnet Stack in C#

This project implements a portion of the BACnet protocol in C#. It should work properly on the Mono platform, and potentially on mobile frameworks provided by Xamarin.

This location for the project is temporary, and the project will migrate to github.com/LorenVS/bacstack soon.
